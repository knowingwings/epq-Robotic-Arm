# Design and Manufacture of a Robotic Arm 

## Introduction
For my EPQ I am designing and manufacturing a robotic arm. I chose this as my artefact as I am interested in a career in robotics.  The design and manufacture of the arm would also draw on skills that I have learnt in my Maths, Physics and Computer Science A Levels.  I decided that an arm that can lift less than 0.8 kilograms would be sufficient for the applications that I might use it for, such as removing prints from a 3D printer or experimenting with different methods in control software.
